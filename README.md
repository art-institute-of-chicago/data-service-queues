# Queues Data Service
> A microservice to retrieve wait times for exhibition lines

This was an internal microservice we used as a shim to Qudini to abstract away the process of retrieving wait times for exhibition lines in a way that integrates well with our data hub.

In September 2022, with an interest towards simplifying the data hub, we decided to retire this microservice. We now query Qudini directly from the data aggregator. This repository is provided as a public archive.
